	Description	Explanation	Prediction
Focus of analysis	Focus is on any variable—understand different variables and their distributions and relationships	Focus is on $X$—understanding the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, often with an emphasis on causality	Focus is on $Y$—forecasting or estimating the value of $Y$ based on $X$, often without concern for causal mechanisms
Names for variable of interest	—	- Explanatory variableBBBB- Independent variableBBBB- Predictor variableBBBB- Covariate	- Outcome variableBBBB- Dependent variableBBBB- Response variable
Goal of analysis	Summarize and explore data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships	*Estimation*: Test hypotheses or theories and make inferences about the relationship between one or more $X$ variables and $Y$PPPP PPPP*Causal attribution*: A special form of estimating—make inferences about the causal relationship between a single $X$ of interest and $Y$ through credible causal assumptions and identification strategies	Generate accurate predictions; maximize the amount of explainable variation in $Y$ while minimizing prediction error
Evaluation criteria	—	Confidence/credible intervals, coefficient significance, effect sizes, and theoretical consistency	Metrics like root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$; out-of-sample performance
Typical approaches	Univariate summary statistics like the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation; multivariate summary statistics like correlations and cross-tabulations	*t*-tests, proportion tests, multivariate regression models; for causal attribution, careful identification through experiments, quasi-experiments, and other methods with observational data	Multivariate regression models; more complex black-box approaches like machine learning and ensemble models
Examples	Summarizing unemployment rates by state or county; cross-tabulations of average unemployment rates by county and demographic group; maps of unemployment rates	Explaining variation in unemployment rates ($Y$) using historical and contemporary economic indicators ($X$); testing whether a job training program ($X$) causes a reduction in unemployment ($Y$)	Forecasting future demand for unemployment benefits ($Y$) based on historical and contemporary economic indicators
