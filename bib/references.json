  {"id":"AngristPischke:2010","abstract":"Since Edward Leamer's memorable 1983 paper, “Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics,” empirical microeconomics has experienced a credibility revolution. While Leamer's suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress—by our lights—is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions. We briefly respond to this concern, which worries us little.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Angrist","given":"Joshua D"},{"family":"Pischke","given":"Jörn-Steffen"}],"citation-key":"AngristPischke:2010","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","DOI":"10.1257/jep.24.2.3","ISSN":"0895-3309","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5]]},"language":"en","page":"3-30","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The credibility revolution in empirical economics: How better research design is taking the con out of econometrics","title-short":"The credibility revolution in empirical economics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jep.24.2.3","volume":"24"},

The ensuing emphasis on internal validity, however, has enabled a neglect of construct and external validity. We show that ignoring construct and external validity within identification strategies undermines the Credibility Revolution’s own goal of understanding causality deductively. Without assumptions regarding construct validity, one cannot accurately label the cause or outcome. Without assumptions regarding external validity, one cannot label the conditions enabling the cause to have an effect. If any of the assumptions regarding internal, construct, and external validity are missing, the claim is not deductively supported. The critical role of theoretical and substantive knowledge in deductive causal inference is illuminated by making such assumptions explicit. This article critically reviews approaches to identification in causal inference while developing a framework called\n              causal specification\n              . Causal specification augments existing identification strategies to enable and justify deductive, generalized claims about causes and effects. In the process, we review a variety of developments in the philosophy of science and causality and interdisciplinary social science methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Esterling","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Brady","given":"David"},{"family":"Schwitzgebel","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"EsterlingBradySchwitzgebel:2025","container-title":"Journal of Causal Inference","DOI":"10.1515/jci-2024-0002","ISSN":"2193-3685","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"20240002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The necessity of construct and external validity for deductive causal inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jci-2024-0002/html","volume":"13"},

It has by now reached a level of maturity that makes it an important tool in many areas of empirical research in economics, including labor economics, public finance, development economics, industrial organization, and other areas of empirical microeconomics. In this review, we discuss some of the recent developments. We focus primarily on practical issues for empirical researchers, as well as provide a historical overview of the area and give references to more technical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Imbens","given":"Guido W"},{"family":"Wooldridge","given":"Jeffrey M"}],"citation-key":"ImbensWooldridge:2009","container-title":"Journal of Economic Literature","container-title-short":"Journal of Economic Literature","DOI":"10.1257/jel.47.1.5","ISSN":"0022-0515","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3]]},"language":"en","page":"5-86","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent developments in the econometrics of program evaluation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/jel.47.1.5","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"Keele:2015","abstract":"Many areas of political science focus on causal questions. Evidence from statistical analyses is often used to make the case for causal relationships. While statistical analyses can help establish causal relationships, it can also provide strong evidence of causality where none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of causal inference. Instead of focusing on specific statistical methods, such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give statistical estimates a causal interpretation. Such assumptions are often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions are critical to any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the design-based approach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Keele","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"Keele:2015","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit. anal.","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mpv007","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"313-335","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Statistics of Causal Inference: A View from Political Methodology","title-short":"The Statistics of Causal Inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1047198700011785/type/journal_article","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"Kitcher:2001","abstract":"Abstract\n            What should be the goal of science in a democratic society? Some say, to attain the truth; others deny the possibility (or even the intelligibility) of truth‐seeking. Science, Truth, and Democracy attempts to provide a different answer. It is possible to make sense of the notion of truth, and to understand truth as correspondence to a mind‐independent world. Yet science could not hope to find the whole truth about that world. Scientific inquiry must necessarily be selective, focusing on the aspects of nature that are deemed most important. Yet how should that judgement be made? The book's answer is that the search for truth should be combined with a respect for democracy. The scientific research that should strike us as significant would address the questions singled out as most important in an informed deliberation among parties committed to each others’ well‐being. The book develops this perspective as an ideal of ‘well‐ordered science’, relating this ideal both to past efforts at science policy and to the possibility that finding the truth may not always be what we want. It concludes with a chapter on the responsibilities of scientists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Kitcher","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"Kitcher:2001","DOI":"10.1093/0195145836.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-514583-0 978-0-19-983334-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",12,13]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Science, truth, and democracy","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/4724"},

Artificial Intelligence is an umbrella term for a set of loosely related technologies. For instance, ChatGPT has little in common with algorithms that banks use to evaluate loan applicants. Both of these are referred to as AI, but in all of the salient ways - how they work, what they're used for and by whom, and how they fail - they couldn't be more different. Understanding the fundamental differences between AI technologies is critical for a technologically literate public to evaluate how AI is being used all around us. In this book, Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor explain the major strains of AI in use today: generative AI, predictive AI, and AI for content moderation. They show readers how to differentiate between them and, importantly, make a cogent argument for which types of AI can work well and which can never work, because of their inherent limitations. AI in this latter category, the authors argue, is AI snake oil: it does not and cannot work. More precisely, generative AI is imperfect but can be used for good once we learn how to apply it appropriately, whereas predictive AI can never work - in spite of the fact that it's being sold and marketed today in products - because we have never been able to accurately predict human behavior.\"--","author":[{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Kapoor","given":"Sayash"}],"citation-key":"NarayananKapoor:2024","event-place":"Princeton Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-691-24913-1 978-0-691-24964-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton Oxford","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"AI snake oil: What artificial intelligence can do, what it can't, and how to tell the difference","title-short":"AI snake oil","type":"book"},

  {"id":"NowlinWehde:2024","abstract":"The use of quantitative methods is ubiquitous across the field of public policy. Such methods are used in policy analysis and evaluation as well as by scholars of the policy process. The broad use of quantitative methods requires that these methods are taught to a wide array of students in various programs including undergraduate programs, Master in Public Administration (MPA), Master in Public Policy (MPP), and Ph.D. programs in public affairs, political science, and economics, among others. In this chapter, we delineate a few key considerations when teaching quantitative methods to policy students. First is know your audience. As noted, students of public policy are spread across programs and have varying career goals. Therefore, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching quantitative methods, rather some students (e.g., MPA) will be best served learning to be sophisticated consumers of quantitative methods, whereas other students (e.g., Ph.D.) will need to be sophisticated users. Second is emphasize theory. Theory - the logical propositions that connect cause and effect - is a vital component of building scientific knowledge and is also vital to policy design and analysis. Therefore, students should understand the importance of theory and how theoretical claims are challenged and empirically tested. Third is learn by doing. Quantitative methods are best understood through application. Students at all levels should be required to find or collect data, determine the appropriate method to analyze that data, and be able to communicate the results. Finally, build good habits. Good habits in quantitative methods include proper data management, openness about assumptions and data limitations, and producing work that can easily be replicated. Additionally, the use of open-source tools is an important component of good habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowlin","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Wehde","given":"Wesley"}],"citation-key":"NowlinWehde:2024","container-title":"Handbook of Teaching Public Policy","ISBN":"978-1-80037-811-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"168-180","publisher":"Edward Elgar Publishing","section":"Handbook of Teaching Public Policy","source":"www.elgaronline.com","title":"Teaching quantitative methods to students of public policy","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781800378117/book-part-9781800378117-22.xml"},

Government at all levels has limped into the digital age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get.
