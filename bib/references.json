The present paper argues that these beliefs are false, and that without intensive data analysis, linear regression models are likely to be inaccurate.

While Leamer's suggested remedy, sensitivity analysis, has played a role in this, we argue that the primary engine driving improvement has been a focus on the quality of empirical research designs. The advantages of a good research design are perhaps most easily apparent in research using random assignment. We begin with an overview of Leamer's 1983 critique and his proposed remedies. We then turn to the key factors we see contributing to improved empirical work, including the availability of more and better data, along with advances in theoretical econometric understanding, but especially the fact that research design has moved front and center in much of empirical micro. We offer a brief digression into macroeconomics and industrial organization, where progress—by our lights—is less dramatic, although there is work in both fields that we find encouraging. Finally, we discuss the view that the design pendulum has swung too far. Critics of design-driven studies argue that in pursuit of clean and credible research designs, researchers seek good answers instead of good questions.

The determinants of aid allocation have shifted significantly. Industrialized states are increasingly unable to insulate themselves from spillovers caused by underdevelopment abroad. Donors attempt to use aid to decrease these spillovers, targeting developing countries where the effects on the donor are anticipated to be large. Once a recipient is chosen, concern for recipient government capacity guides the composition of aid. Empirical analysis of aid allocation from 1973 to 2012 demonstrates that, while explanations based on security and economic ties to the donor explain allocation well in the Cold War, the post-2001 period is best understood by incorporating a role for targeted development.

However, algorithmic bias has the potential to reinforce racial inequities in postsecondary success. We provide a comprehensive and translational investigation of algorithmic bias in two separate prediction models—one predicting course completion, the second predicting degree completion. We show that if either model were used to target additional supports for “at‐risk” students, then the algorithmic bias would lead to fewer marginal Black students receiving these resources. We also find the magnitude of algorithmic bias varies within the distribution of predicted success. With the degree completion model, the amount of bias is over 5 times higher when we define at‐risk using the bottom\n              decile\n              than when we focus on students in the bottom\n              half\n              of predicted scores; in the course completion model, the reverse is true. These divergent patterns emphasize the contextual nature of algorithmic bias and attempts to mitigate it. Our results moreover suggest that algorithmic bias is due in part to currently‐available administrative data being relatively less useful at predicting Black student success, particularly for new students; this suggests that additional data collection efforts have the potential to mitigate bias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"Kelli A."},{"family":"Castleman","given":"Benjamin L."},{"family":"Song","given":"Yifeng"}],"citation-key":"BirdCastlemanSong:2024","container-title":"Journal of Policy Analysis and Management","container-title-short":"J Policy Anal Manage","DOI":"10.1002/pam.22569","ISSN":"0276-8739, 1520-6688","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,31]]},"language":"en","page":"pam.22569","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Are algorithms biased in education?

We focus on a selective subset of contributions aligning with four broad topics: causal effect identification and estimation in general, causal effect heterogeneity, causal effect mediation, and temporal and spatial interference. We describe how machine learning, as an estimation strategy, can be effectively combined with causal inference, which has been traditionally concerned with identification. The incorporation of machine learning in causal inference enables researchers to better address potential biases in estimating causal effects and uncover heterogeneous causal effects. Uncovering sources of effect heterogeneity is key for generalizing to populations beyond those under study. While sociology has long emphasized the importance of causal mechanisms, historical and life-cycle variation, and social contexts involving network interactions, recent conceptual and computational advances facilitate more principled estimation of causal effects under these settings. We encourage sociologists to incorporate these insights into their empirical research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Brand","given":"Jennie E."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Yu"}],"citation-key":"BrandZhouXie:2023","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"ChettyHendrenKline:2014","abstract":"Abstract\n            We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child’s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4% in Charlotte but 12.9% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Chetty","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Hendren","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Kline","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Saez","given":"Emmanuel"}],"citation-key":"ChettyHendrenKline:2014","container-title":"The Quarterly Journal of Economics","DOI":"10.1093/qje/qju022","ISSN":"0033-5533, 1531-4650","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1553-1623","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Where is the land of opportunity?

  {"id":"ChettyHendrenKline:2014a","abstract":"We present new evidence on trends in intergenerational mobility in the United States using administrative earnings records. We find that percentile rank-based measures of intergenerational mobility have remained extremely stable for the 1971-1993 birth cohorts. For children born between 1971 and 1986, we measure intergenerational mobility based on the correlation between parent and child income percentile ranks. For more recent cohorts, we measure mobility as the correlation between a child's probability of attending college and her parents' income rank. We also calculate transition probabilities, such as a child's chances of reaching the top quintile of the income distribution starting from the bottom quintile. Based on all of these measures, we find that children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s. However, because inequality has risen, the consequences of the “birth lottery” - the parents to whom a child is born - are larger today than in the past.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Chetty","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Hendren","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Kline","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Saez","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Nicholas"}],"citation-key":"ChettyHendrenKline:2014a","container-title":"American Economic Review","container-title-short":"American Economic Review","DOI":"10.1257/aer.104.5.141","ISSN":"0002-8282","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"141-147","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Is the United States still a land of opportunity?

The ensuing emphasis on internal validity, however, has enabled a neglect of construct and external validity. We show that ignoring construct and external validity within identification strategies undermines the Credibility Revolution’s own goal of understanding causality deductively. Without assumptions regarding construct validity, one cannot accurately label the cause or outcome. Without assumptions regarding external validity, one cannot label the conditions enabling the cause to have an effect. If any of the assumptions regarding internal, construct, and external validity are missing, the claim is not deductively supported. The critical role of theoretical and substantive knowledge in deductive causal inference is illuminated by making such assumptions explicit. This article critically reviews approaches to identification in causal inference while developing a framework called\n              causal specification\n              . Causal specification augments existing identification strategies to enable and justify deductive, generalized claims about causes and effects. In the process, we review a variety of developments in the philosophy of science and causality and interdisciplinary social science methodology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Esterling","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Brady","given":"David"},{"family":"Schwitzgebel","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"EsterlingBradySchwitzgebel:2025","container-title":"Journal of Causal Inference","DOI":"10.1515/jci-2024-0002","ISSN":"2193-3685","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","page":"20240002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The necessity of construct and external validity for deductive causal inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jci-2024-0002/html","volume":"13"},

Despite extensive accounts of civil rights mobilization and narratives of state building, there has been surprisingly little research that explicitly examines the importance and consequence that civil rights activism has had for the process of state building in American political and constitutional development. Through a sweeping archival analysis of the NAACP's battle against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923, this book examines how the NAACP raised public awareness, won over American presidents, and secured the support of Congress. In the NAACP's most far-reaching victory, the Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional rights of black defendants were violated by a white mob in the landmark criminal procedure decision Moore v. Dempsey. This book demonstrates the importance of citizen agency in the making of new constitutional law in a period unexplored by previous scholarship.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Francis","given":"Megan Ming"}],"citation-key":"Francis:2014","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9781139583749","ISBN":"978-1-139-58374-9 978-1-107-69797-3 978-1-107-03710-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,21]]},"license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Civil rights and the making of the modern American state","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781139583749/type/book"},

Commonly used estimands include the average treatment effect in the treated (ATT), the average treatment effect in the untreated (ATU), the average treatment effect in the population (ATE), and the average treatment effect in the overlap (i.e., equipoise population; ATO). Each estimand has its own assumptions, interpretation, and statistical methods that can be used to estimate it. This article provides guidance on selecting and interpreting an estimand to help medical researchers correctly implement statistical methods used to estimate causal effects in observational studies and to help audiences correctly interpret the results and limitations of these studies. The interpretations of the estimands resulting from regression and instrumental variable analyses are also discussed.

Recent changes to U.S. healthcare policy prompted by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), however, provide adults with new pathways for accessing a key form of social welfare—health insurance— decoupled from employers, spouses, and children. Taking advantage of this fundamental shift in the country’s system of social welfare provision, I use data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to explore patterns of health insurance coverage from before and after the ACA became active in 2014. The results show that the salience of labor market, marriage, and family attachments as pathways to coverage significantly declined in the first three years following passage of the ACA. By providing adults with a new route to coverage decoupled from their institutional attachments, the ACA helped narrow health insurance inequalities across gender, race and ethnicity, and education. Given the strong association between health insurance and health outcomes, the results from this study raise important questions about the centrality of institutional attachments for our knowledge of health inequalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gutierrez","given":"Carmen M."}],"citation-key":"Gutierrez:2018","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122418811112","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1144-1170","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The institutional determinants of health insurance: Moving away from labor market, marriage, and family attachments under the ACA","title-short":"The institutional determinants of health insurance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418811112","volume":"83"},

This paper investigates how these incentives are distributed across income groups for three types of subsidies (manufacturer or retailer rebates, utility rebates, and tax credits) and eight types of equipment. While incentives are always concentrated in higher-income households, there is substantial heterogeneity in the magnitude of the concentration depending on how incentives are structured. Tax credits are the type of subsidy that is most concentrated in higher-income households and utility rebates are the least. Incentives for appliances that are not universally-owned, including dishwashers and clotheswashers, are more concentrated than are incentives for other types of equipment. Differences across income groups in the rates of equipment presence and turnover, willingness to purchase Energy Star models, and rates of homeownership contribute to the concentration. After controlling for these factors, utility rebates are no longer concentrated in higher-income households, but manufacturer / retailer rebates and tax credits remain so.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Jacobsen","given":"Grant D."}],"citation-key":"Jacobsen:2019","container-title":"The Energy Journal","container-title-short":"The Energy Journal","DOI":"10.5547/01956574.40.6.gjac","ISSN":"0195-6574, 1944-9089","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11]]},"language":"en","license":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","page":"171-198","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An examination of how energy efficiency incentives are distributed across income groups","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.5547/01956574.40.6.gjac","volume":"40"},

While statistical analyses can help establish causal relationships, it can also provide strong evidence of causality where none exists. In this essay, I provide an overview of the statistics of causal inference. Instead of focusing on specific statistical methods, such as matching, I focus more on the assumptions needed to give statistical estimates a causal interpretation. Such assumptions are often referred to as identification assumptions, and these assumptions are critical to any statistical analysis about causal effects. I outline a wide range of identification assumptions and highlight the design-based approach to causal inference. I conclude with an overview of statistical methods that are frequently used for causal inference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Keele","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"Keele:2015","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit. anal.","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mpv007","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"313-335","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The statistics of causal inference: A view from political methodology","title-short":"The statistics of causal inference","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1047198700011785/type/journal_article","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"KeeleTitiunik:2015","abstract":"Political scientists often turn to natural experiments to draw causal inferences with observational data. Recently, the regression discontinuity design (RD) has become a popular type of natural experiment due to its relatively weak assumptions. We study a special type of regression discontinuity design where the discontinuity in treatment assignment is geographic. In this design, which we call the Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design, a geographic or administrative boundary splits units into treated and control areas, and analysts make the case that the division into treated and control areas occurs in an as-if random fashion. We show how this design is equivalent to a standard RD with two running variables, but we also clarify several methodological differences that arise in geographical contexts. We also offer a method for estimation of geographically located treatment effects that can also be used to validate the identification assumptions using observable pretreatment characteristics. We illustrate our methodological framework with a re-examination of the effects of political advertisements on voter turnout during a presidential campaign, exploiting the exogenous variation in the volume of presidential ads that is created by media market boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Keele","given":"Luke J."},{"family":"Titiunik","given":"Rocío"}],"citation-key":"KeeleTitiunik:2015","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit. anal.","DOI":"10.1093/pan/mpu014","ISSN":"1047-1987, 1476-4989","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"127-155","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Geographic boundaries as regression discontinuities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1047198700011645/type/journal_article","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"KingNielsen:2019","abstract":"We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal—thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"KingNielsen:2019","container-title":"Political Analysis","container-title-short":"Polit.

Some say, to attain the truth; others deny the possibility (or even the intelligibility) of truth‐seeking. Science, Truth, and Democracy attempts to provide a different answer. It is possible to make sense of the notion of truth, and to understand truth as correspondence to a mind‐independent world. Yet science could not hope to find the whole truth about that world. Scientific inquiry must necessarily be selective, focusing on the aspects of nature that are deemed most important. Yet how should that judgement be made? The book's answer is that the search for truth should be combined with a respect for democracy. The scientific research that should strike us as significant would address the questions singled out as most important in an informed deliberation among parties committed to each others’ well‐being. The book develops this perspective as an ideal of ‘well‐ordered science’, relating this ideal both to past efforts at science policy and to the possibility that finding the truth may not always be what we want.

  {"id":"LiYarime:2021","abstract":"Abstract\n            Contemporary data tools such as online dashboards have been instrumental in monitoring the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. These real-time interactive platforms allow citizens to understand the local, regional, and global spread of COVID-19 in a consolidated and intuitive manner. Despite this, little research has been conducted on how citizens respond to the data on the dashboards in terms of the pandemic and data governance issues such as privacy. In this paper, we seek to answer the research question: how can governments use data tools, such as dashboards, to balance the trade-offs between safeguarding public health and protecting data privacy during a public health crisis? This study used surveys and semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives of the developers and users of COVID-19 dashboards in Hong Kong. A typology was also developed to assess how Hong Kong’s dashboards navigated trade-offs between data disclosure and privacy at a time of crisis compared to dashboards in other jurisdictions. Results reveal that two key factors were present in the design and improvement of COVID-19 dashboards in Hong Kong: informed actions based on open COVID-19 case data, and significant public trust built on data transparency. Finally, this study argues that norms surrounding reporting on COVID-19 cases, as well as cases for future pandemics, should be co-constructed among citizens and governments so that policies founded on such norms can be acknowledged as salient, credible, and legitimate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Veronica Qin Ting"},{"family":"Yarime","given":"Masaru"}],"citation-key":"LiYarime:2021","container-title":"Data & Policy","container-title-short":"Data & Policy","DOI":"10.1017/dap.2021.27","ISSN":"2632-3249","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e29","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Increasing resilience via the use of personal data: Lessons from COVID-19 dashboards on data governance for the public good","title-short":"Increasing resilience via the use of personal data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2632324921000274/type/journal_article","volume":"3"},

However, scholars generally justify the exclusion restriction based on its plausibility. I propose a method for searching for additional violations implied by existing social science studies. I show that the use of weather to instrument different independent variables represents strong prima facie evidence of exclusion‐restriction violations for all weather‐IV studies. A review of 289 studies reveals 194 variables previously linked to weather: all representing potential exclusion‐restriction violations. Using sensitivity analysis, I show that the magnitude of many of these violations is sufficient to overturn numerous existing IV results.

However, as machine learning (ML) advances lead to more accurate predictive models in fields like lending, education, healthcare, and criminal justice, policymakers may find themselves better positioned to implement effective fairness measures. Using credit bureau data and ML, we show that setting different lending thresholds for low‐ and moderate‐income (LMI) neighborhoods relative to non‐LMI neighborhoods can equalize the rate at which equally creditworthy borrowers receive credit. ML models alone better identify creditworthy individuals in all groups but remain more accurate for the majority group. A policy that equalizes access via separate thresholds imposes a cost on lenders, but this cost is outweighed by the substantial gains from ML. This approach aligns with the motivation behind existing laws such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which encourages lenders to meet the credit needs of underserved communities. Targeted Special Purpose Credit Programs could provide the opportunity to prototype and test these ideas in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Meursault","given":"Vitaly"},{"family":"Moulton","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Santucci","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Schor","given":"Nathan"}],"citation-key":"MeursaultMoultonSantucci:2024","container-title":"Journal of Policy Analysis and Management","container-title-short":"J Policy Anal Manage","DOI":"10.1002/pam.22662","ISSN":"0276-8739, 1520-6688","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,30]]},"language":"en","page":"pam.22662","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"One threshold doesn't fit all: Tailoring machine learning predictions of consumer default for lower‐income areas","title-short":"One threshold doesn't fit all","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pam.22662"},

We tie information from reports submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that we collected to administrative caseload and expenditure data to document several strategies that states currently use to comply with federal work requirements. We estimate that FRA will increase the stringency of work requirements in 23 states and that five states will begin to fall short of requirements. We note that several compliance strategies available to these states do not encourage work.

Understanding the fundamental differences between AI technologies is critical for a technologically literate public to evaluate how AI is being used all around us. In this book, Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor explain the major strains of AI in use today: generative AI, predictive AI, and AI for content moderation. They show readers how to differentiate between them and, importantly, make a cogent argument for which types of AI can work well and which can never work, because of their inherent limitations. AI in this latter category, the authors argue, is AI snake oil: it does not and cannot work. More precisely, generative AI is imperfect but can be used for good once we learn how to apply it appropriately, whereas predictive AI can never work - in spite of the fact that it's being sold and marketed today in products - because we have never been able to accurately predict human behavior.\"--","author":[{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Kapoor","given":"Sayash"}],"citation-key":"NarayananKapoor:2024","event-place":"Princeton Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-691-24913-1 978-0-691-24964-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton Oxford","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"AI snake oil: What artificial intelligence can do, what it can't, and how to tell the difference","title-short":"AI snake oil","type":"book"},

  {"id":"NowlinWehde:2024","abstract":"The use of quantitative methods is ubiquitous across the field of public policy. Such methods are used in policy analysis and evaluation as well as by scholars of the policy process. The broad use of quantitative methods requires that these methods are taught to a wide array of students in various programs including undergraduate programs, Master in Public Administration (MPA), Master in Public Policy (MPP), and Ph.D. programs in public affairs, political science, and economics, among others. In this chapter, we delineate a few key considerations when teaching quantitative methods to policy students. First is know your audience. As noted, students of public policy are spread across programs and have varying career goals. Therefore, there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching quantitative methods, rather some students (e.g., MPA) will be best served learning to be sophisticated consumers of quantitative methods, whereas other students (e.g., Ph.D.) will need to be sophisticated users. Second is emphasize theory. Theory - the logical propositions that connect cause and effect - is a vital component of building scientific knowledge and is also vital to policy design and analysis. Therefore, students should understand the importance of theory and how theoretical claims are challenged and empirically tested. Third is learn by doing. Quantitative methods are best understood through application. Students at all levels should be required to find or collect data, determine the appropriate method to analyze that data, and be able to communicate the results. Finally, build good habits. Good habits in quantitative methods include proper data management, openness about assumptions and data limitations, and producing work that can easily be replicated. Additionally, the use of open-source tools is an important component of good habits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Nowlin","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Wehde","given":"Wesley"}],"citation-key":"NowlinWehde:2024","container-title":"Handbook of Teaching Public Policy","ISBN":"978-1-80037-811-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,12]]},"language":"eng","page":"168-180","publisher":"Edward Elgar Publishing","section":"Handbook of Teaching Public Policy","source":"www.elgaronline.com","title":"Teaching quantitative methods to students of public policy","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollchap/book/9781800378117/book-part-9781800378117-22.xml"},

Just when we most need our government to work-to decarbonize our infrastructure and economy, to help the vulnerable through a pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats-it is faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it's not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an approach taking hold that keeps pace with today's world and reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve.

We represent this structural function as a conditional expectation of an unbiased signal that depends on a nuisance parameter, which we estimate by modern machine learning techniques. We first adjust the signal to make it insensitive (Neyman-orthogonal) with respect to the first-stage regularisation bias. We then project the signal onto a set of basis functions, which grow with sample size, to get the best linear predictor of the structural function. We derive a complete set of results for estimation and simultaneous inference on all parameters of the best linear predictor, conducting inference by Gaussian bootstrap. When the structural function is smooth and the basis is sufficiently rich, our estimation and inference results automatically target this function. When basis functions are group indicators, the best linear predictor reduces to the group average treatment/structural effect, and our inference automatically targets these parameters. We demonstrate our method by estimating uniform confidence bands for the average price elasticity of gasoline demand conditional on income.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Semenova","given":"Vira"},{"family":"Chernozhukov","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"SemenovaChernozhukov:2021","container-title":"The Econometrics Journal","DOI":"10.1093/ectj/utaa027","ISSN":"1368-4221, 1368-423X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,29]]},"language":"en","license":"https://academic.oup.com/journals/pages/open_access/funder_policies/chorus/standard_publication_model","page":"264-289","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Debiased machine learning of conditional average treatment effects and other causal functions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/ectj/article/24/2/264/5899048","volume":"24"},
