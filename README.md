## Abstract

### 🕵️🌸: Note on “snoopy spring” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, I used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate a
[NICKA-style](https://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/codenames.html)
internal-to-me project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.2 (2023-10-31).

codename(type = "nicka", seed = "pubpol stats")
#> [1] "snoopy spring"
```
